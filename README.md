Digital Resume
language: HTML / CSS
• The totality of your source files, except all useless files (binary, temp files, obj
files,...), must be included in your delivery.
Design and create a page (or a set of pages) that you could host to have an online resume.
Your code should be clean and use the proper HTML and CSS properties with a clear
separation between the twos.
Feel free to add animations and whatever can both improve your resume for the viewer (which could be a
potential recruiter) and show your personnality.
Your website MUST be responsive!
Organize cleverly your files and directories!
Here are some examples:
• a simple but elegant one
• a funny one, inspired by amazon
• an interactive and graphical one
The usage of frameworks and librairies is authorized. You main goal for the next two days is for you to
pratice using HTML/CSS and have a good digital resume at the end.
